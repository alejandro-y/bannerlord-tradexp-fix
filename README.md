# TradeXPFixModule

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord mod that fixes trade XP gain across save/load.

Should be obsolete after Native v1.4.

# Installation

Git clone, build (see below), run the game launcher and enable the module.

# Usage

Just trade without fear that your progress will be lost.

# Development

Works fine with VS2019 Community Edition.

VSCode + .NET Core SDK + `dotnet build` @ powershell should be fine too.

Copy `env.example.xml` to `env.xml` and edit the settings according to your environment. Watch out for the ampersand in XML files.

The `PostBuild.ps1` script will auto execute on successful builds, and assemble the final distributable folder of the module inside the `.\dist` directory as well as install it to the game dir.

To build using CLI:
```ps1
PS C:\path-to-src\> dotnet build -c Debug # or Release
```
